There has been a sharp increase in the adoption of its applications in various sectors. For example, facial recognition and biometric systems have become an integral part of almost all types of industries. The COVID-19 pandemic has multiplied the demand for such contactless technological systems.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"desc-img\" src=\"\/img\/ai-trends.jpg\" alt=\"Image Recognition Trends\"><\/p>\n<p>Image recognition is a facet of computer vision that employs artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to recognize objects. Here are some of the current leading image recognition trends.<\/p>\n<h2>Contactless Payments<\/h2>\n<p>The financial sector is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the evolving image recognition technology, where image recognition has been implemented in various systems both on the customer side and the back-end office.<\/p>\n<p>This technology has now enabled users to make payments not only without cash, but now also without cards. Already working in many countries, the payment systems employ facial and image recognition to identify and authenticate users, making payments easier and more secure. Other e-commerce companies, including Amazon, are already moving towards making their payment mechanism cardless through this powerful technology.<\/p>\n<h2>Personalized Customer Experience<\/h2>\n<p>Customer experience is undoubtedly a vital element of business success. Companies are increasingly embracing image recognition systems like facial recognition and biometrics to provide their customers premium personalized services. By implementing such systems, customers can receive customized products and services based on their specific needs and requirements by simply logging in using their faces or other biometrics.<\/p>\n<h2>Digital Security<\/h2>\n<p>Issues related to the identification and authentication of users are a significant concern in online banking and e-commerce services. Without a physical presence, ensuring secure financial transactions and preventing information theft can be a big challenge. Here, image recognition plays a vital role in the development of foolproof and accurate security mechanisms that can recognize and authenticate people using images of faces, eyes, or fingerprints.<\/p>\n<p>Biometric features are more effective and secure than traditional knowledge-based techniques like passwords and usernames. Tech gurus are predicting that image recognition will eventually replace or be used together with other mediums in security systems. For example, we see already today an increase in the adoption and deployment of two-factor authentication.<\/p>\n<h2>Health Care Sector<\/h2>\n<p>Image recognition is becoming more and more common in the healthcare sector as well. The technology is not only used to provide patients fast access to medical care facilities by recognizing them, but also helps to prevent insurance frauds and scams. Using biometric systems, healthcare providers can keep track of the patient\u2019s medication, identify illnesses and recognize people with hereditary diseases. Doctors can also use image recognition when analyzing various x-ray images and other scans to automatically detect or assist in identifying illnesses and diseases.<\/p>\n<h2>Travel and Hospitality Sector<\/h2>\n<p>Already under consideration by many world-class hotels, facial recognition may eliminate the need to carry a room card key for guests. With the technology adding more convenience and ease, the risk of losing your key or getting yourself self-locked outside the room is minimized.<\/p>\n<p>With image recognition, tourists and travelers will be able to register, check in, and check out without any necessary point of contact. From flight booking to boarding and accessing your hotel, everything may be done through facial recognition and authentication in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>Digital Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Image recognition is also being employed in the marketing world. Here,  marketers will be able to identify and classify individuals based on their demographics and facial characteristics. This will help make more personalized advertising campaigns and direct the marketing messages to the right people at the right time.<\/p>\n<h2>Image Tagging<\/h2>\n<p>Image recognition technology can help companies deal with large quantities of imagery information, enabling companies to sort, classify and store the data systematically. By automatically tagging images, the assignment of relevant tags or keywords to a large number of pictures and images can be performed. Sophisticated image recognition systems help extract characteristics and recognize objects of interest to provide companies with a cost-effective and efficient solution to deal with vast volumes of picture content.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image Recognition is one of the most trending technological breakthroughs in the world.
