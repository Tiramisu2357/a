It uses biometrics to map facial features from an image or a video. A facial recognition system starts with creating databases for relevant faces to find a match. Due to increasing public security threats, this technology is high in demand as it helps in verifying personal identity, which leads to improving security and reducing the crime rate.<\/p>\n<p>Facial recognition is mostly being used in consumer applications like mobile unlocking or organizing your Google or Facebook photos. Besides just consumer applications, the governments are also making a shift in their regular security systems by adding facial security, particularly to the criminal justice context.<\/p>\n<p>In the present era, preventing crimes is not something out of science fiction books. Facial recognition is now a reality. Most of the world\u2019s most prominent law enforcement agencies, retail stores, and transportation systems are actively using this advanced technology to stop crimes even before they occur.<\/p>\n<h2>Top 5 Face Recognition Applications to Reduce Crime Rate<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the most significant sectors that are making use of the facial recognition system to improve security:<\/p>\n<h3>Police Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Policing is the sector where face recognition offers intelligent services. It can identify as well as memorize the faces of concerned people like criminals, a network of gang members, and those suspected in violent crimes. The system does not require any prior engagement to recognize an individual and considers only data to capture the identity. This brings great transparency to the decision-making process during an investigation.<\/p>\n<h3>Airport Security<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"desc-img\" src=\"\/img\/airport-security.jpg\" alt=\"Airport security\"> Facial recognition has now become a standard technology at the airports. Today, a lot of people own a biometric passport that helps them to avoid long queues and follow an automated ePassport control to proceed to the gate faster without even having to answer the questions of police officers. This has significantly reduced waiting time at the passport control parallel to adding security in and around airports.<\/p>\n<h3>Retail Stores<\/h3>\n<p>Many of the highly-known retail stores have implemented facial recognition and surveillance cameras to scan the faces of shoplifters as well as suspicious characters. The security officers use a proactive approach rather than a reactive one, to avoid injuries or perhaps even fatalities. If the system identifies someone as a shoplifter, it sends out an alert as soon as the person enters the store. Current research shows that identifying dishonest customers before they even commit any crime has reduced retail violence by 91 %.<\/p>\n<h3>Examination Centers<\/h3>\n<p>A prominent sector where illegal credential sharing occurs is online education. Schools, colleges, and universities are using facial recognition to crack down on students who cheat by sending a brainy roommate to sit their exams. The exam management centers are using strong authentication technologies using biometrics to reduce the practice of cheating during these types of events.<\/p>\n<h3>Casino Gambling<\/h3>\n<p>Gambling has become a health issue in most of the developed countries. The government of many countries has set restrictions and limits to help those suffering from this addiction. Facial technology is being used to keep track of customers who are gambling addicts. The surveillance cameras are installed around the premises to help the casino staff identify certain people and keep a record of their day\u2019s play. This makes the job of security staff easier because they know when to stop particular persons after seeing their specific gambling patterns. It is also used to stop already banned individuals who have a history of fraudulent behavior from visiting gambling premises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facial recognition is the way of identifying human faces with the help of technology.
