It has grown to be so effective because it uses deep learning algorithms that are designed to resemble the way a human mind works. These algorithms make computers capable of recognizing different elements in an image.<\/p>\n<p>Image recognition is offering exciting opportunities similar to the ones that we only used to see in science fiction movies and is running our imagination wild. Let\u2019s have a look at some of the great uses of image recognition in different sectors:<\/p>\n<h2>5 Best Uses of Image Recognition<\/h2>\n<h3>Automated Photo Organization<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"desc-img\" src=\"\/img\/top5.jpg\" alt=\"Image Recognition face\"> This photo organization system is the most popular application of image recognition that you experience almost daily \u2013 organizing your photos on the phone. If you pay attention to your mobile\u2019s gallery, you\u2019ll see a different library of photos based on your memories or visual topics, from personal issues to landscapes.<\/p>\n<p>Besides just offering photo storage, all of the smartphones are going a step ahead by providing people better search and discovery features to organize their extensive database of photos. They have integrated image recognition APIs that identify patterns in pictures and group them accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Visual Search to Discover Products<\/h3>\n<p>Visual search has taken the e-commerce industry to the next level. Many online retailers have experienced increased sales and growth as they introduced the feature of visual product search for their customers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you are standing at a store, and some product catches your attention. You want to know all the details of this product. That\u2019s where visual search shows its magic. It allows you to take an image of the product using the app of that store. You will then be directed to the online product page that contains all the necessary information about that product.<\/p>\n<h3>Face Recognition on Social Media<\/h3>\n<p>I hope you all are familiar with Facebook\u2019s face recognition feature for tagging people in photos. This photo tagging is one of the most used application of image recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you upload a photo, Facebook recognizes the objects and people being in there, before you even write a description. This feature is made possible because of computer vision that distinguishes different objects, food, facial expressions, and landscapes based on smart algorithms. Besides tagging, image recognition is also used for translating visual content to visually impaired users as well as identify inappropriate or abusive images.<\/p>\n<h3>Food Recognition Technology<\/h3>\n<p>You will see another even more exciting use of image recognition in the food industry. There\u2019s a company called SRI that uses images of foods to provide nutritional information using computer vision. This technology offers two kinds of data: recognizing food and estimating the volume of food. The data is then utilized to process information about the food, portion size, as well as the nutritional value.<\/p>\n<h3>Behavior Monitoring in Classrooms<\/h3>\n<p>It is interesting to know that image recognition has made its way into classrooms as well. Some classes may use facial recognition to monitor the behavior of students. In this case, with the help of a facial recognition camera that scans the students in a classroom following a specified interval. The system records all the activities, including writing, reading, leaning on the desk, raising hands, movement of faces, and the emotions of the pupils.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technology has undoubtedly become an essential part of our lives, and machine learning is acting as the protagonist behind all these latest tech advancements.
