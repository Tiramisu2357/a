However, in the last few years, image recognition has become a reality and a popular topic of research. It has become one of the most worked technologies of this era.<\/p>\n<p>Image recognition has completely changed the way we perceive, classify, and search for visual information. Many companies and industrial sectors like e-commerce, marketing, gaming, social media, sports, as well as healthcare, and automotive safety are working to provide better solutions. This advancement will benefit people by using technology to help with tasks that are too complex or time-consuming for humans to complete alone.<\/p>\n<h2>Current Successful Applications of Image Recognition<\/h2>\n<p>The image recognition technology is growing at a rapid pace, beyond the regular use of image recognition to which we have gotten accustomed. This revolutionizing technology has gone far beyond our imagination and is going to continue to expand.<\/p>\n<p>As this advanced technology is equivalent to giving eyes to a blind person \u2013 its range of applications is limitless. It is being used by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Law enforcement firms and airports to catch lawbreakers<\/li>\n<li>Gamers to use the real location as a battlefield for virtual adventurers<\/li>\n<li>Doctors to perform microsurgical procedures<\/li>\n<li>Stores to keep track of their products and sales<\/li>\n<li>Security officers for security and home automation cameras<\/li>\n<li>Developers to overcome the shortcomings of virtual and augmented reality<\/li>\n<li>And many more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Image Recognition Advancement and Future Scope<\/h2>\n<h3>Launching Self-Driving Cars<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"desc-img\" src=\"\/img\/future.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Image Recognition and self driving cars\"> We all know that autonomous cars will become a reality sooner or later. Although big companies such as Tesla Motors have already launched their first project of driverless cars, the technology is facing some issues. For now, the technology is not good enough for you to fall asleep while sitting in a self-driving car. However, in the near future, you\u2019ll see highly stable self-driving vehicles that will be able to correctly identify different objects on the road while maintaining safety and secure speed.<\/p>\n<h3>Boosting Augmented Reality Gaming<\/h3>\n<p>New and exciting but rapidly advancing, augmented reality has become a significant subject in computer vision as it offers entertainment and provides useful guidance for unknown spaces and complex buildings. The gaming arena has widely started using image recognition with augmented reality to create realistic experiences for gamers. They are taking benefit of image recognition for designing the environment and characters that relate with their users.<\/p>\n<h3>Initiating City Guides<\/h3>\n<p>Would you love to choose your next travel destination based on real-time photos of the location that other tourists have posted? Well, this idea is already out there \u2013 all thanks to image recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Jetpac is a company that uses Instagram photos to create virtual city-guides. The algorithm uses image analysis algorithms to extract data from images that are publicly available and then analyze them to provide information to the users. In the future, you will see that the city-guides will become standard for everyone with extensive data from almost all the regions of the world.<\/p>\n<h3>Teaching Machines to Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Besides some great applications of image recognition in the consumer market, you will see this technology taking important industrial and manufacturing decisions. The AI-powered image recognition systems will be able to create devices that will automatically detect current as well as previously unknown defects in the manufacturing phase, based on their ability to learn. This development will lead to a system of reliable and error-less production processes.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing Medical Imagery<\/h3>\n<p>Given the rise of image recognition usage in the medical industry, there will be an ever-growing need for smarter technology in the future. The medical imagery is being trained by the latest image recognition technology to transform the field of diagnosis by making the detection of complex internal diseases easier.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier image recognition technology was considered a fantasy of science fiction.
