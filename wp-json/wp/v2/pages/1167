Our brains have the capabilities to think, reason, analyze and find solutions to various types of problems. We can feel and learn from our experiences. We can also adapt to changing environments and use past knowledge to make decisions for future actions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"desc-img\" src=\"\/img\/machine-human.jpg\" alt=\"AI machine vs. human\"><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, machines that are powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed to replicate human intellect. They work through simulation and training that enable them to accomplish goals like humans. Compared to the human brain, machines require much energy and many previous examples to learn.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines vs. Humans: Who is Smarter?<\/h2>\n<p>There are different schools of thought prevalent in this regard. Different experts and scientists see the question differently. Some believe that humans can program a machine to think and act like a human. They argue that machines can be made to work like human brains. With a machine being intelligent at its core, it will start restructuring its intelligence and evolve eventually.<\/p>\n<p>In such a scenario, there may come a time when machines based on AI technology can become more intelligent than humans. However, there are still others who negate this notion entirely. They deduce that machines can never be smarter than humans. Surpassing human intelligence is impossible for AI or any other human-made technology.<\/p>\n<p>Machines lack a living body and cannot feel and think emotionally. They can reason based on information but cannot learn from experiences like childhood, cultural practices, and maintaining relationships. Therefore, in many aspects, machines cannot surpass human intelligence.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines Cannot Become Smarter than Humans<\/h2>\n<p>Human beings grow over time. We are not programmed or designed with specific commands. With humans proven to be the most dominant living species on the planet, our intelligence is natural and has not been manufactured in a laboratory. On the other hand, machines are simply programs that simulate human intelligence. Below are some common arguments for why machines are not smarter than humans.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines Lack Mindfulness<\/h2>\n<p>Machines cannot gain the consciousness that humans can. They can have a perception of what is around them, but they cannot feel it intrinsically. Although they can build up memories like humans, or even better than humans, they cannot make judgments and decisions without necessary inputs.<\/p>\n<p>Lacking the flexibility to adapt, change and maneuver the thought process, machines cannot think beyond a predefined set of information. They lack the ability to anticipate and can produce results based on restricted programming. Machines can perform the assigned task, but cannot reason why it is acting in a certain way. The basic working of the machine on its own is unconscious and aimless.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines Lack Creativity and Rationality<\/h2>\n<p>Machines, especially those powered by AI, are regarded as thinking computers. However, no matter how sophisticated they are programmed, they cannot think and act like humans. Machines have the ability to do convergent thinking. This means they can solve problems based on information and data previously provided to them. On the other hand, humans also think convergently but can deviate from the information provided. This means that humans can think creatively \u201cout of the box\u201d while machines cannot.<\/p>\n<p>When humans work on a problem, we try to find several possible solutions. We also think abstractly based on emotions and feelings. On the contrary, machines primarily work towards getting the most likely correct answer to a problem. Here, machines are better for scientific calculations and problem-solving.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines Cannot Learn on Their Own<\/h2>\n<p>Machines can only handle situations they are programmed to do. They cannot rewrite their own code and evolve technically. Humans, on the other hand, take every day as a learning opportunity. We learn from past experiences and can also make a way forward if something is occurring for the first time.<\/p>\n<h2>AI can surpass human accuracy<\/h2>\n<p>There are also arguments of why machines are more intelligent or better than humans. With the emerging field of machine learning and deep learning, machines can learn from past experiences and make decisions on new areas that have not been encountered before.<\/p>\n<p>In some domains, for example, image recognition, it has been shown that machine-based classifiers can surpass human accuracy. As machines are able to handle much data at an incredible speed, some tasks can be performed better than humans. Another example is in the context of autonomous driving. While self-driving cars still cause human injuries and even casualties, the frequency is much less than human drivers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Humans are born with intellect.
